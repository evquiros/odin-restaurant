# Restaurant Page Project

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum, specifically from the JavaScript path's Restaurant Page lesson. It involves building a simple, modular, and interactive restaurant website using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. The primary objective is to apply ES6 modules, Webpack, and the concept of separating code into reusable components.

## Project Overview

The Restaurant Page project focuses on creating a multi-page experience within a single-page application (SPA) using JavaScript. Users will be able to navigate between different sections, such as Home, Menu, and Contact, without reloading the page.

## Key Skills and Concepts

- **ES6 Modules**: Breaking down code into modular, reusable pieces.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Using JavaScript to dynamically render different pages within the app.
- **Webpack**: Setting up and bundling modules to efficiently serve resources.

## Project Structure

The project includes three main components:

1. **Home Page**: Provides a welcoming overview of the restaurant.
2. **Menu Page**: Displays a list of dishes offered by the restaurant.
3. **About Page**: Provides some history about the restaurant.
